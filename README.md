# GUI based Deep Learning Platform for Compute Vision 

A gui based low code deep learning platform for compute vision, which is implemented by [paddlepaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) and [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

Paddlepaddle is a popular open-sourced deep learning framework which has similar encoding style like pytorch. Based on paddlepaddle, many great algorithm suites have been developed, such as [paddleclas](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas) for image classification, [paddleseg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg) for image segmentation, [paddledetection](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection) for object detection, etc. In order to facilitate developing compute vision products for non-specialists, this project will build a pure gui deep learning platform of compute vision. Users can use this platform to complete usual deep learning steps such as data annotation, training, validation and deployment even without any professional knowledge.

Considering that all algorithm suites of paddlepaddle are implemented by python, we will adopt a purely efficient python web framework flask as the restful-api backend. 

If you are interested in this project, you can also participate in. Looking forward to your joining.
