# GUI based Deep Learning Platform for Compute Vision 

VisionGUI is an end-to-end platform to annotate, train and automate computer vision pipelines. With the help of this tool, one can scale annotation and computer vision projects of all sizes using the smartest tools, robust data management systems as well as outsourced services.

VisionGUI is developed using [paddlepaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) and [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Paddlepaddle is a popular open-source deep learning framework which is similar to pytorch or tensorflow. Based on paddlepaddle, many integrated algorithm suites have been developed, such as [paddleclas](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas) for image classification, [paddleseg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg) for image segmentation, [paddledetection](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection) for object detection, etc. Considering that all algorithm suites of paddlepaddle are implemented by python, we will adopt a purely efficient python web framework flask as the restful-api backend. 

If you are interested in this project, you can also participate in. Looking forward to your joining.
